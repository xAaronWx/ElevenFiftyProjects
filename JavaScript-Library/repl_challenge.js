// Write an object literal that stores information about your favorite movie.

// nameOfMovie, runTime, characters, and genre should be keys directly inside the object.

// characters will be an array that should store no more than two (2) character objects, each of which stores name, age, and items.

// items itself will also be an array that should store no more than two (2) item objects.

// These items objects can have key-value pairs of whatever you would like (ex. {itemOne: 'Bow and Arrow'}).

// Use console.log statements to show that you can print out the nameOfMovie, runTime, the characters, the name of a character, and one of the items a character has. Your console should look similar to the screenshot below.

let movie = {
  name: "Krull ",
  runTime: 164,
  characters: 
  genre:
};
