                <p class="">
                  commonly known simply by his surname Fry, is a fictional
                  character and the protagonist of the animated sitcom Futurama.
                  He is voiced by Billy West using a version of his own voice as
                  he sounded when he was 25.[1][2] He is a slacker delivery boy
                  from the 20th century who becomes cryogenically frozen and
                  reawakens in the 30th century to become a delivery boy there
                  with an intergalactic delivery company run by his 30th great
                  grandnephew (31st great grandson; via time warp), Professor
                  Hubert J. Farnsworth. He is the best friend and roommate of
                  Bender and the boyfriend and later husband of Turanga Leela.
                  He is the father of Yancy Fry, Sr. (due to an affair with his
                  soon-to-be paternal grandmother) and the stepfather of Kif's
                  offspring (due to Kif's pregnancy and Leela's accidental
                  motherhood).

                <p class="">
                  Turanga Leela is a fictional character from the animated
                  television series Futurama. Leela is spaceship captain, pilot,
                  and head of all aviation services on board the Planet Express
                  Ship. Throughout the series, she has an on-again, off-again
                  relationship with Philip J. Fry, the central character in the
                  series. The character, voiced by Katey Sagal, is named after
                  the Turangal√Æla-Symphonie by Olivier Messiaen. She is one of
                  the few characters in the cast to routinely display competence
                  and the ability to command, and routinely saves the rest of
                  the cast from disaster. However, she suffers extreme
                  self-doubt because she has only one eye and grew up as a
                  bullied orphan. She first believes herself an alien, but later
                  finds out she is the least-mutated sewer mutant in the history
                  of 31st-century Earth. Her family (particularly her parents'
                  accent and "outcast" status) parodies aspects of pollution and
                  undesirability associated with industrial New Jersey when
                  compared with New York City.

                  Bender Bending Rodr√≠guez
                </h2>
                <p class="">
                  ender Bending Rodr√≠guez (designated in-universe as Bending
                  Unit 22, unit number 1,729, serial number 2716057[1]) is one
                  of the main characters in the animated television series
                  Futurama. He was conceived by the series' creators Matt
                  Groening and David X. Cohen, and is voiced by John DiMaggio.
                  He fulfills a comic, antihero-type role in Futurama and is
                  described by fellow character Leela as an "alcoholic,
                  whore-mongering, chain-smoking gambler".[2] According to the
                  character's backstory, Bender was purpose built in Tijuana,
                  Mexico (the other characters refer to his "swarthy Latin
                  charm") a reference to bending in Mexican maquiladoras.
                  Viewers are informed, through his own testimony, of Bender's
                  prejudice against non-robots. For example, one of his
                  signature expressions is "kill all humans". Exceptions who are
                  not subject to Bender's prejudicial attitude are those
                  individuals on his "Do Not Kill" list, which seems to comprise
                  only his best friend Philip J. Fry and his colleague Hermes
                  Conrad (added after the episode "Lethal Inspection").[3]
                  However, Bender is also occasionally portrayed as possessing a
                  sympathetic side, suggesting that he is not as belligerent as
                  he claims, a view often echoed by his friends.
