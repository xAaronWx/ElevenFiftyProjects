      <h3>Redbird State Park</h3>
    </a>
    <h4>15298 W County Road 350 N</4>
      <h4> Linton, IN 47441</h4>

      <p class="para-2">Named after the Redbird Coal Mine, the property is approximately 1,400 acres of former surface
        and
        underground coal mine land. Its unique history has given us both treasures and challenges. Miles of trails for
        all
        skill levels bring ORV enthusiasts to the property and reward them with rich and diverse experiences. Gentle
        slopes to the technically difficult, can be found at Redbird. The mining operations also left us with a property
        that has required extensive reclamation efforts that continue today, and will continue into the future. Several
        acres within Redbird are highly sensitive and require visitors to be ever respectful and aware of the land.
        Fortunately, these challenges heighten our awareness of the need for trails that thrill our visitors and give us
        the opportunity to provide diverse recreation opportunities.</p>
